                        <p><a href="https://collab.iisg.nl/web/labourconflicts/tabel">The IISG Strikes database</a> is a secondary historical resource created by the historian Dr. Sjaak van der Velden. It is an ongoing research work on compiling information about various types of labour actions in the Netherlands dating as far back as 13721 and up to 2008 (in our version of the data, version of September 2012. It contains in semi-structured format information about the type of labour action (e.g. strike, lock out, demonstration, boycott, etc.), the dates, duration, companies affected, industrial sectors, number of participants, type of participants (for special groups such women, young workers, immigrants etc.), trade unions and chambers involved, reasons, locations, outcomes, information sources, action results, etc..

                        <h3>The KB newspapers archive</h3>
                        <p><a href="http://www.kb.nl">The KB newspapers archive</a> is an online collection of digitised Dutch daily newspapers
dating from 1618 to 1995. An 8% of the 8,000 available newspaper titles have been
selected for digitisation, based on a variety of political, socio-economical, cultural,
religious and journalistic criteria.
The digitised data is in XML format, following Dublin Core [5] metadata standards.
The digitised newspapers have undergone OCR processing and the various articles
and newspaper sections have been semi-automatically segmented. The metadata
provided include newspaper title, page, section type (eg article, advertisement etc.),
publication and digitisation dates, author, publisher, etc.

                        <p>
<a href="/strikes/">The visualisation interface</a> for the Strikes case study provides a visual interface to
the process undertaken in <a href="http://ilk.uvt.nl/hitime/">HiTiME</a> and <a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/DID-ISHER/">ISHER</a> projects for discovering articles related
to strike events in the KB archive and linking these to strike entity events, as these
are defined and described in the Strikes DB. The overall objective of the visualisation interface for the Strikes case study is the
provision of a visual overview of linked and associated data from primary and
secondary historical resources, such as the Strikes DB and the KB archive. This data overview is intended to support historians in retrieving information and in spotting
significant data trends across time and space that may lead to new insights about
historical facts and events that were thus far scattered along various sources.

                        <h3>About Strikes</h3>
                        <p>Labour conflicts are an important phenomenon in the history of capitalism, but also in other societies in which unequal labour relations exist. Through labour conflicts, social, economic, political and legal relations have been greatly altered. Researchers concerned with social and economic history but also those involved with institutional or political history cannot ignore labour conflicts.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Historical Research</h3>
                        <p>
                        Therefore, data on labour conflicts is among the most important sources of information in historical research. The International Institute of Social History (IISH) has taken the initiative to set up a moderated list of data files of strikes, lockouts and other labour conflicts. Scholars working in this field are invited to register their work, and to make their data available through the internet - either on their own web pages (which may be made accessible through the IISH-list) or on the web pages of the IISH.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Our Data</h3>
                        <p>
                        The long term goal is to enhance the exchange and (re-)use of these data in order to write truly international-comparative histories of the development of labour conflicts.
                        All data bases will not only include the data themselves, but also descriptions of the way in which they are constructed, the sources used, and relevant publications in which the data are analyzed.
                        </p>
